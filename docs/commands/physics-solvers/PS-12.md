## OBJECTIVE
Implement The Layered Solver Pipeline (Orchestrator) as a decision-complete command in the Physics Solvers track.

## CONTEXT
This command migrates authoritative implementation intent from TECHNIQUE_05_PHYSICS_INSPIRED_SOLVERS.md section PS-12 into the canonical execution format.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
- Source of truth: `TECHNIQUE_05_PHYSICS_INSPIRED_SOLVERS.md section PS-12`.
- Implement exact algorithms, interface behavior, parameter values, and failure handling defined in the source.
- Preserve compatibility with existing workspace architecture and prior commands in this track.

## FILES TO CREATE
- Create or update only the files explicitly required by the source specification.
- Define exact public interfaces and signatures needed by downstream commands.
- Add supporting private helpers where needed to keep functions focused.

## TESTS REQUIRED
- Add focused unit tests for primary behavior and edge handling.
- Add regression tests for known failure paths in this command scope.
- If this command is integration-oriented, add an end-to-end test for the full connected flow.

## EDGE CASES
- Implement and test all edge cases explicitly listed in the source specification.
- Add validation for malformed inputs and out-of-range parameters.
- Ensure failure behavior is explicit and actionable.

## ANTI-SKELETON RULES
- No placeholder comments.
- No empty function bodies.
- No silent error handling.
- No unsafe typing in public interfaces.
- Every branch and error path in this command scope must be tested.

## VERIFICATION
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `npx vitest run`
- [ ] `rg -n "placeholder marker pattern" src/` returns no matches
- [ ] `rg -n "any-or-unsafe-type pattern" src/` returns no matches

## INTEGRATION CONTRACT
- PREREQUISITES: `PS-11`
- EXPOSES: Implemented interfaces and behavior required by downstream commands in this track.
- DO NOT REFERENCE: Future commands that are not yet completed.

## COMPLETION CRITERIA
1. All required files and interfaces are implemented with full behavior.
2. Tests and verification checks are complete and green.
3. Update PROGRESS.md with implemented scope, tests added, and discovered gotchas.
4. Commit and stop.
