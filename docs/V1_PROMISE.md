# Project Omni-Twin V1 Promise

## Included in V1
- Web-first viewer with pan, zoom, and grid overlays (2D/3D toggle).
- Place tables and chairs with snap, rotate, and live seat counts.
- Inventory-aware catalog limited to on-hand items.
- Save and load layouts for a venue.
- Scenario creation (branch, label, compare) tied to a base layout.
- Exports: PDF layout pack and inventory summary list.

## Explicitly out of scope for V1
- Compliance or code checks (fire, ADA, egress, or capacity enforcement).
- Splat capture or photogrammetry ingest.
- VR walkthroughs or headset support.

## Guardrails
- V1 is single-venue, single-user planning; collaboration and permissions are deferred.
- Quality bar is fast iteration and reliable exports, not production-grade analytics.
